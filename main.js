			" radix system calculated by even decimal fraction creat" +
			"ing a hierarchy of relatively symmetrical numbers inclu" +
			"ding the Alpha, an infinitesimal and the Omega, its lar" +
			"ge reflection both being positive and due to the nature" +
			" of being even fractions the result of every enumerated" +
			" Alpha multiplied by its symmetrical Omega is always 1." +
			" The concept begun with the idea that Infinity could be" +
			" represented as 1 followed by endless 0s but no decimal" +
			" places because it is a whole Infinity, controversial h" +
			"ence the rename to a Maxxisimily Infinity and 1 Maxxism" +
			"ily also known as Maxxisimily Alpha which has the same " +
			"idea but symmetrically opposite the decimal point. Tech" +
			"nically both values are undefined but their concepts ca" +
			"ncel each other out resulting in I/A === 1.0/0.1 which " +
			"is the base number to the recursion. This is a study of" +
			" patterns and balance in numbers.",
